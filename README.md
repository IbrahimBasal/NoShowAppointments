## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found that there was a strong relationship between the age and patient attendence of appointment
most people at 20-40 years old are paitent and attend the appointment . patient at 50 years old or above aren't attend appointment because they cann't go alone or they were died . new born and kids who is patient are most attendence because they need care at this age .
exploration show that average mean age of female that attend is about 35 years old which is larger than male(30 years old) and average mean age of female that isn't attend is about 38 years old which is larger than male(29 years old) .


## Key Insights for Presentation

> i tried to found a relationship between the age and show up of patient and it show that average mean age for female who 's attend is larger than male and it is a good feature for predicting whether the patient will come or not.
